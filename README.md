# SNAP-COLA
Machine readable file with allotments, income eligibility standards, and deductions for the USDA Food and Nutrition Service - Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

I prepared this machine readable file because I could not find a single resource that provided, over time, information on maximum allotments, income eligiblity standards, and deductions for the SNAP program. My plan is to update this document as time allows for other researchers, as well as the effort of my own team in ACES at Illinois.
